        <h3>About the site</h3>
        <p>This is a Web Development Capstone Project for the Code:You May 2025 cohort by Kerry McKenney.</p>
        <p>This website was created using the <a href="https://louisville-metro-opendata-lojic.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/LOJIC::louisville-metro-ky-restaurant-inspection-scores/about">Louisville Metro KY Restaurant Inspection Scores</a> provided by the Department of Public Health and Wellness.
        </p>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I chose this project because I wanted to work with data that was local to me and could be beneficial for other Louisville residents. 
        I also have a background and interest in environmental health and safety. 
        Having easily accessible data about restaurant health codes is important for the general public to be aware of to make informed decisions about the establishments they support. 
        The information is available at the link above but it is not easy to search through and covers over 10,000 establishments in Louisville, KY, including schools and hospitals.
        My goal was to make that information more approachable. I intend to continue to extend the capabilities of this website as it is currently limited to 1,000 establishments when using the Fetch API. 
        Right now the search only includes regularly scheduled health inspections. In the future I also intend to include complaints and details about health and safety violations.
